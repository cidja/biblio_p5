/*This code does 3 things:

    It defines the title of the page in $title. This will be integrated in the <title> tag in the template.

    It defines the content of the page in $content. It will be integrated in the <body> tag in the template.
    As this content is a bit big, we use a trick to put it in a variable. We call 
    the ob_start() function (line 3) which "memorizes" all the HTML output that follows, then, at the end, we retrieve 
    the content generated with ob_get_clean() (line 28) and put it in $content .

    Finally, it calls the template with a require. This one will retrieve the variables $title and $content that we just created... to display the page!
